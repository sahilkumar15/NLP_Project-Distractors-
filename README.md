# Generating Distractors for question

MCQs are widely-used question format that is used for general assessment on domain
knowledge of candidates. Most of the MCQs are created as paragraph-based questions.

A Paragraph or code snippet forms the base of such questions. These questions are created
based on the three or four options from which one option is the correct answer. The other
remaining options are called Distractors which means that these options are nearest to the
correct answer but are not correct.
